/**
@mainpage Domain and Entity Classes Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the domain and entity classes in our TP1 project!

@section intro Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the domain and entity classes used in our project. It explains their purpose, structure, and how they contribute to the overall architecture.

@section overview Overview of Domain and Entity Classes

Domain and entity classes are fundamental components that embody important concepts and entities within the context of our project. Domain classes serve to encapsulate the business logic and behaviors specific to our project's domain, representing real-world concepts and processes. On the other hand, entity classes primarily represent persistent data entities that have a distinct identity and are typically stored in a database.

@section concepts Key Concepts and Terminology

- **Domain Classes**: Classes that encapsulate domain logic and represent concepts from the problem domain.
- **Entity Classes**: Classes that represent persistent data and have identity.

@section structure Structure of the Documentation

The documentation is organized into sections corresponding to different aspects of our domain and entity classes. You can navigate through the documentation to learn about specific classes, their relationships, and usage patterns.

@section getting_started Getting Started

To get started with using the documentation, you can:
- Navigate through the class hierarchy to explore different domain and entity classes.
- Refer to the examples and usage patterns provided in the documentation.
- Consult the reference documentation for detailed information on individual classes and their members.
